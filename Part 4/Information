## PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS
For the development of our model, we first installed all the necessary libraries to create a confusion matrix (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn).

These were the following steps in order:

  - Loaded the dataframe created during data collection
  - Created a column for our training label (“Class”) created during data wrangling
  - Standardized the data
  - Split the data into training data and test data

The next step consisted in fitting the training data to various model types:

  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier

Used a cross-validation grid-search over a variety of hyperparameters to select the best ones for each model:

  - Enabled by Scikit-learn function GridSearchCV

Evaluated accuracy of each model using test data to select the best model.
