# SQL:
We started off our exploratory data analysis with SQL.
After loading the data we ran SQL queries in order to display and list information about:

  - Launch sites
  - Payload mass
  - Booster versions
  - Mission outcomes
  - Booster landings


# VISUALIZATION:
In terms of Visualization, we read the dataset into a Pandas data frame so we could then use libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot the results obtained.
Examples of created plots:

  - FlightNumber X PayloadMass
  - FlightNumber X LaunchSite
  - Payload X LaunchSite
  - OrbitType X SuccessRate
  - FlightNumber X OrbitType
  - Payload X OrbitType
  - Year X SuccessRate
