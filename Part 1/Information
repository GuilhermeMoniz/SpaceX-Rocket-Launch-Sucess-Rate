## DATA COLLECTION

API:
Regarding these steps, we started by acquiring some historical launch data from SpaceXâ€™s Open Source REST API, in which we requested and parsed their launch data using the GET request.
Then we filtered the data frame, only to include the Falcon9 launches. Finally, we replaced any missing payload mass values from classified missions with their mean.

WEB SCRAPING:
In regards to this next process, we started by requesting the Falcon9 launch Wiki page from its Wikipedia URL.
Then extracted all column/variable names from the HTML table header.
Finally, we parsed the table and converted it into a Pandas data frame.


## DATA WRANGLING
The objective for this part was to explore the data and determine the label for training supervised models:

  - Calculated the number of launches of each site
  - Calculated the number and occurrence of each orbit
  - Calculated the number of occurrence of mission outcome per orbit type
